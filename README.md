ðŸš€ About this repository
This repository is part of my journey to sharpen and consolidate my JavaScript fundamentals, with a focus on modern development using React and TypeScript. Here, you'll find well-structured examples, revisited concepts, and practical exercises aimed at building scalable and maintainable front-end applications.

I'm revisiting core JavaScript concepts to ensure clean, efficient, and robust code â€” skills that are essential for high-quality React and TypeScript projects.
